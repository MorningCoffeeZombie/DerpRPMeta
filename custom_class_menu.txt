Why is custom class so expensive?			
	It requires server reboot to take effect.		
	Requires making numerous edits across our codebase.		
	If any 1 thing is wrong, it crashes the whole server and will wipe staff permissions.		
	Adds new content to server, increasing time it takes player to join in (discourages new players)		
	Offsets the RP with classes that are potentially OP.		
	You can buy the 'share class' and drastically reduce cost		
	Support the server.		
			
Custom Class Rules			
	Not exempt from any server rules		
	Players will receive no special treatments		
	Players cannot puchase the arrest baton on its own (must be done via PD functions package)		
	Mandatory 1 week waiting time after purchase via paypal before work on class begins (limit charge backs)		
	Players cannot just pay $750 to join someone elses custom class. Original owner's consent MUST be provided first.		
	If multiple players split the initial purchase of a custom class; 51% of them must agree when new players pay $750 to join in.		
	RP job maximum is 5 (playing as class at once), this will not change. Maximum amount of buy-ins is unlimited.		
	Buy-ins are permanent, the staff/owners will not become involved in personal drama.		
	Staffing abilities, permissions, etc. will never be for sale (no: playerphys, noclip, ignite, etc.)		
	If the server's SWEP, car, or model packs change; the class owner will be allowed to pick a replacement from existing options.		
	You may not copy the name and models of another pre-existing custom class/create-a-job without consent from the owner.		
	Models may not be overly distracting or out of place (no massive, tiny, or invisible models.)		
			
Dev notes			
	For each class sold; add the purchaser's steam id should be commented into the header (for basic documentation)		
	Create a 'category.lua' for all custom class, should appear above VIP category		
	Some bundles will require doorgroups, chatgroups, etc.		
	Shoud extra packages also add players to chatgroups?		
	Giving access to other jobs/ents. Will require the "allowed = {}" flag be added with the job for each thing contained in the addon ever…
