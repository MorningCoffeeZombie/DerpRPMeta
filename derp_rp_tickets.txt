IF YOU COMPLETE SOMETHING - DO NOT REMOVE IT! CROSS IT OFF
	(So we know what we did)


// HIGH PRIORITIES
//////////////////
Get all critical files/mods/etc. in git for version control.
	Can/should the repos just be condensed to a "Addons/*" or at least ("AddonsEconomy/*", "AddonsCars/*, etc.)?
		Could introduce branched repo
	Need vanilla server files added
	Need base mods added



// FIX THE ECONOMY
//////////////////

Money printers
	Increase print time
	Decrease payout
	Decrease upgrade / purchase costs
	Require non-afk action (refill, fix, etc.)
	Only 2-4 printers (of any type) max. per player
Cash Burns
	Hunger
	Theft
	Ammo (decrease default ammo)
	Consumables (guns, food, apparel, buffs, etc.). Things that are destroyed upon death/jail.
		Non-refundable (or consumable entities)
			DJ radios
			Microwaves
			Tip jars
	Gambling / Lottories
--	Property prices (pay to own a base)
	Taxes
	Bail (early realease from PD)
	Materializing player models (until they log off)
--Bitcoin
--	Decrease gas usage / increase duration of fuel
--	Decrease BTC price (payout)
--	Increase max. amount fuel cannisters
--	Decrease max. amount generators
	Decrease wait time between purchasing fuel
		This is not in the bitminers code, must be part of the UI
		(More for UI) can the terminal be improved?
	Adjust cost of upgrades (CPU cores, etc.)
Cars
	Decrease price
	Fix ratio of purchase : repair
Guns
	Stabilize price
Jobs
	Decrease wages (eliminate wages?). You get money for nothing/afk-ing 
Robbery (bank, jewelry, etc.)
	Decrease payout
	Decrease total bags/vault
Casino
	Review/adjust odds
	"Barrier to entry" to "potential payout" ratio far too favorable for players
	/casino, decrease speed of stock market results. Make the % gains take longer.
	/casino, add possibility for small -% streaks (more realistic, helps balance)
	mCasino settings may be held via api. check /mlib/lua/autorun/mlib.lua for this:	"https://api.m4dsolutions.com:8130/mlib/"
Unbox
--	Hide money boxes (will be used later but are currently OP)
	Perma sweps should be offered via donation / credit only
Drugs
	Must serve a consumable purchase
	Require user to take more risk to sell / deliver
--		Adjusted for meth mod
	More risky to run and manage (goes to theft)
--		Adjusted for meth mod
	Do something better than a "lean cup"








// SET CO CLASS TO > SUPERADMIN
///////////////////////////////
Only accomodate co-owner class once properly in place
Bump SA down 1 step below CO



// LEGISLATION
//////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Create a written system of consistent, concise, yet fun server rules.
Implement case law.
Ban/punish on intent rather than action or outcome


// THEME & ASTHETICS
////////////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Consistent UI
Consistent color scheme / art style
Vibrant HUE and color schemes
	'Rose colored classes' or Halo: Reach styles, not Gears of War
Consistent player model usage (no "sanic" the hedgehogs...)
Integrate F4 + /Casino + /Unbox + donations
Hide blacklisted options from Q menu
	Useless tools
	Extra tabs. (Shaders, Entities, Weapons, etc.)
Shop Menus
	Decrease the wait time between spawning multiple of the same object (purchasing fuel, printers, etc.)
Unbox
	Purchased keys should combine into a single key image with an (x10 or x5) just for simplicity's sake)
Add ability for players to locally mute eachother
Hide player rank (Mod, Admin, etc.) from the front page of Tab menu.
	Require at lease 1-2 more clicks to view. Helps keep RP active / prevents special treatment.
Customized decals and images for game buildings, entities, etc.


// CUSTOM MAP
/////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Size matters
	Small but not over crowded
	Large but not empty feeling
Must be easy to navigate
	Nothing maze like or overly layred (like C18)
Must have hidden OOC rooms:
	Staff rooms
	Banishment/jail room
	Minigame room?
	Full sized event room


// MONETIZATION
///////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Can only monetize server upon stability and player base development
API to permit BTC / ETH / LTC server donations (not the in-game currency; the real crypto)
Paypal integration


// PROPS & BUILDING
///////////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Decrease current methods of spam protection
	Props shouldn't auto-freeze in air. Makes it touch to build
	Props auto-nocollide with eachother. (General comfort improvement). Also prevents model collision based spam / crashing.
Create / publish a literal whitelist
	Make it easier for player to know which props are valid
Integrate Fading Door tool with Keypad tool. (Left click to fade, right to place related keypad).
Exploits
	Remove ability for players to hotkey a faded door. (Too easily abused).


// META & DEV OPS
/////////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Create a Jira/Trello for agile development
Develope the website/forums
PR & recruitment of players from other communities & servers to join DerpRP.


// RP
/////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Mayor's law set to a UI element rather than bill boards
	Prevents players from claiming to not know current laws
Allow player sprays?


// CLIENT & SERVER OPTIMIZATION
///////////////////////////////
(food for thought - to be expanded on later)
Multicore rendering option
Remove FPS governor (if possible)
Boost connection speeds (if possble) (also attempt via server's CPanel console)
Tricks up sleeves (things that can be cut if needed)
	Lights & Lamps cause lag
	Contraints cause lag
	Autoremover props that fell through map
