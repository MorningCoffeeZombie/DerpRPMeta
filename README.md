# Coding Standards

* Preserve default config vaules (when possible) by commenting them out and creating a new/edited line directly below the changed code.  
* Comment!  
* Write your code as simple as possible. It should be easy to understand if never seen before.  
* Code should be written as if it is case sensitive.  
* Commit / Push your code every time you begin working on a new or unrelated topic from your previous edits. (Assuming code is stable)  
* Preserve file paths and structures.  
* Prioritize relative coding over hard-coding.  
+ Preface Arrays with "arr_", Functions with "fun_" (or similar; but consistent).  
	* Variables are common enough it shouldn't matter.
